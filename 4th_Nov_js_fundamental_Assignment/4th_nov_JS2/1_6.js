/*Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is crucial for 
several reasons, as it significantly enhances code readability, maintainability, 
and collaboration.  */

//here aresome key reasons that why meaningful variable names are important:
    //Descriptive variable names make the code more readable and understandable.
    //Meaningful variable names simplify code maintenance. 
    //When multiple developers work on a project, meaningful variable names facilitate collaboration. 
    //Clear and descriptive variable names can aid in debugging.

// Unclear and less readable variable names
let x = 10;
let y = 5;

let result = x + y;
console.log(result); // What does 'result' represent?

// Improved with meaningful variable names
let baseSalary = 1000;
let bonus = 500;

let totalSalary = baseSalary + bonus;
console.log(totalSalary); // Clearer understanding of the calculated value
